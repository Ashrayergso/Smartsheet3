1. Django Settings: The Django settings file "my_project/my_project/settings.py" will contain configuration for the entire Django project. This includes database settings, installed apps, middleware classes, template settings, etc. These settings will be shared across all the other files in the project.

2. URL Patterns: The "my_project/my_project/urls.py" and "my_project/app/urls.py" files will contain URL patterns for the Django project and the app respectively. These URL patterns will be used by Django to route incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate view based on the URL.

3. Django Models: The "my_project/app/models.py" file will contain the data models for the Django app. These models define the structure of the database tables and are used by Django's ORM to interact with the database. The models will be used in the views and admin files.

4. Django Views: The "my_project/app/views.py" file will contain the views for the Django app. These views take a web request and return a web response. They can read records from the database models and pass them to a template. They can also update records in a database model.

5. Django Admin: The "my_project/app/admin.py" file will contain configuration for the Django admin site. This file will use the models defined in "my_project/app/models.py".

6. Django Apps: The "my_project/app/apps.py" file will contain the configuration for the Django app. This configuration is used by Django's app loading mechanism.

7. Django Templates: The "my_project/app/templates/app/index.html" and "my_project/app/templates/app/result.html" files will contain the HTML templates for the Django app. These templates will use the context data passed from the views to generate the final HTML.

8. Static Files: The "my_project/app/static/app/css/style.css" and "my_project/app/static/app/js/script.js" files will contain the CSS styles and JavaScript code for the Django app. These files will be used in the HTML templates.

9. Utility Functions: The "my_project/app/utils.py" file will contain utility functions that can be used across the Django app. These functions can be used in the views, models, and other parts of the app.

10. DOM Elements: The HTML templates and JavaScript files will share DOM element IDs for manipulating the HTML elements using JavaScript.

11. Message Names: The views and templates may use message names for displaying messages to the user. These message names will be shared between the views and templates.

12. Function Names: The views, models, utility functions, and JavaScript files will share function names. These function names are used to call the functions from different parts of the app.
